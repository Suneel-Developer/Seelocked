                Offer Acceptance and Cancellation
            </h3>

            <p class="subttitle">
                Our offer to purchase is based on your representation of the physical condition of your electronic
                device(s). All offers are contingent on your electronic device(s) being in the same condition as you
                represented. Such determination will be made in the sole and absolute discretion of selllocked.com. If,
                after inspecting your electronic device(s), we cancel the offer, we will return your electronic
                device(s) to you. <br> <br>
                Any offer you receive is good for three (3) business days. If you do not ship your electronic device(s)
                to us within three (3) business days of receiving our offer, it may expire. However, once we make you an
                offer and you then send your electronic device(s) to us, we have the right to buy your electronic
                device(s) at the agreed upon price. In other words, you cannot unilaterally cancel after you send us
                your electronic device(s).

            <h3 class="title">
                No Unlawful or Prohibited Purpose Property
            </h3>

            <p class="subttitle">
                As a condition of your use of this Website, you warrant to selllocked.com that you will not use the
                Website for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms and Conditions. SELLLOCKED.COM
                DOES NOT PURCHASE STOLEN OR OTHERWISE ILLEGALLY OBTAINED GOODS. In any transaction, you represent and
                warrant that the device or devices you intend to sell are rightfully owned by you or were otherwise
                legally obtained by you. Prior to selling us a locked or lost device, you must take all reasonable
                measures to try and locate the original owner as well as follow any and all applicable laws related to
                abandonment of property.

                Duties of Resellers
            </h3>

            <p class="subttitle">
                As a reseller, you agree that you have conducted, and will continue to conduct, your own due diligence
                for all sales, in the past and in the future, to determine that the devices you're purchasing have been
                obtained legally, and that the seller is the legal and rightful owner of the device or devices they plan
                to sell to you. You agree that it is NOT OK to have a "don't ask, don't tell" policy when purchasing
                devices. You agree that you know how and why the seller is in possession of the devices they are selling
                to you, and that the reasoning they have provided you with makes sense and does not seem suspicious. If
                something is not adding up, or the seller seems suspicious, you agree that you will NOT go through with
                a sale. If someone is attempting to sell you abandoned property, you agree that you have made sure that
                they have made a reasonable attempt to contact the original owner and have allowed for enough time to
                pass that would be deemed reasonable for the original owner to claim it.

                Financed Devices
            </h3>

            <p class="subttitle">
                If you are selling a device that you are currently financing and are responsible for making payments on,
                you agree that you intend to continue making payments on the device or devices you sell to us, even
                after you have sold them. Likewise, if you purchase financed devices from a third-party to resell to us,
                you agree to make that third-party aware that they are still responsible for making payments on their
                devices, even after you purchase them to resell to us. Any agreement that you or a third-party have made
                with a carrier or other leasing entity to finance a device will still be valid even after you sell it to
                us.

                Payment Terms
            </h3>

            <p class="subttitle">
                Upon a successful physical inspection of your electronic device(s) we will pay you the agreed upon
                amount within five (5) business days based on the payment option you select.

                Seller Warranties
            </h3>

            <p class="subttitle">
                Seller expressly warrants that for a period of one year after selllocked.coms purchase of the Sellers
                electronic device(s), the device(s) will conform to the descriptors Seller used in connection with the
                sale of the device(s) to selllocked.com (e.g. status/lock, carrier, condition). If, within one year,
                selllocked.com discovers these descriptors are untrue or have changed, selllocked.com will calculate the
                difference in price between the device(s) as they were represented by Seller at the time of sale, and
                the actual condition of the device(s) and their prices at the time the discrepancies were discovered,
                and will mail a Notice to Seller. Seller agrees to refund the price difference to selllocked.com within
                thirty (30) days from the date of the Notice. SellLocked.com also reserves the right to return the
                device(s) to the seller for a full refund.

                Shipping Policy
            </h3>

            <p class="subttitle">
                Once we make you an offer, you will be able to print out a prepaid shipping label in order to send us
                your electronic device(s) for physical inspection. You assume all risk of the electronic device(s)
                getting lost, stolen, damaged or undelivered during shipping. We recommend that you insure your shipment
                against loss, theft, and damage. For questions about how to insure your package, please reach out to
                customer support. <br><br>
                You should erase all personal data before shipping your device. Although we will do the best we can to
                protect and erase personal data on all devices we purchase, we make no guarantee to do so. In some
                instances, we may be unable to erase a device's contents. So, we highly recommend that you erase your
                own data before sending a device to us so that you can ensure any personal information is destroyed.
                <br><br>
                You should also remove your SIM Card before shipping your device to us. We do our best to remove and
                destroy SIM Cards from the devices we purchase, however, there are some instances where we are unable to
                do so. For example, if a device is brand new and sealed, we will not open it to remove and destroy the
                SIM Card. You agree that, in any case, we are not responsible if a customer that we resell your device
                to comes into possession of your SIM Card. It is up to you to remove your SIM Card before sending your
                device to us.

                Governing Law and Statute of Limitations
            </h3>

            <p class="subttitle">
                This Website is controlled by us from our offices within the State of Arizona, United States of America.
                It can be accessed from all 50 states, as well as from other countries around the world. As each of
                these places has laws that may differ from those of Arizona, by accessing this Website both of us agree
                that the statutes and laws of the State of Arizona, without regard to the conflicts of laws principles
                thereof, will apply to all matters relating to the use of this Website and the sale of products and
                services through this Website. Each of us agrees and hereby submits to the exclusive personal
                jurisdiction and venue of the Maricopa County Superior Court and the United States District Court for
                the District of Arizona with respect to such matters.
                <br><br>
                In any action to enforce these Terms and Conditions, the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and
                attorneys' fees. In the event that any of the Terms and Conditions are held by a court or other tribunal
                of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, those provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the
                minimum extent necessary so that these Terms and Conditions shall otherwise remain in full force and
                effect.
                <br><br>
                Any cause of action brought by you against us or our Affiliates must be instituted within one year after
                the cause of action arises or be deemed forever waived and barred.
